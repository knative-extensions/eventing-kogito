# Kogito Source Roadmap

Kogito Knative Eventing Source features are highly aligned with
the [Kogito Operator](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-operator/)
and [Kogito Runtimes](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-runtimes) and their respective releases. However, the Kogito
Source release is aligned with Knative Eventing release train.

Check the [release notes](https://github.com/knative-sandbox/eventing-kogito/releases) for more details about each
released version.
