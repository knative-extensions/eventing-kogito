## OLM can't bind the Knative's ClusterRole addressable-resolver automatically to our controller SA (kogito-source-controller) since we don't know
## the installed namespace preemptively.

## This way, during the bundle generation, we download from the Knative Eventing repo the aggregated ClusterRoles and
## bind them with this file

## Then, the operator-sdk CLI can read and compose the spec.permissions.clusterPermissions field in the CSV.
## See Makefile -> bundle.
